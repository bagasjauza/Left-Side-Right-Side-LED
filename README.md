# Left-Side-Right-Side-LED
Left Side Right Side LED is inspired by a song called KING by Kanaria.
This system is based on Arduino. The project uses 3 LEDs and 2 buttons which function to adjust the direction of the blinking led. 

There is 3 condition in this project:
1.The LED will blink to the right side
2. The LED will blink to the left side
3. The LED will turn off 

Every time the first button is pressed, the condition will change to the next state. If the second button is pressed, the condition will be back to the previous state.
